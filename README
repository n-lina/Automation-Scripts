delete.py: 
    I have a large backup of photos on my computer. I wanted to move my photos to the cloud without exceeding the free cloud storage limit. To save space, I wrote this script to isolate the duplicate images. I consider an image to be a duplicate if it has the same modification time and date and size as another image.
